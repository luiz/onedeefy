h1. What is this

Suppose you want to treat an image as a single line. You can do that in many ways. One of them is to run through the image in a spiraling fashion: go straight until you either reach the border of the image or you reach a pixel you've already been at, then turn right.

This is an implementation of the algorithm described above (and its inverse). It's still quite simple, but feel free to use, send feedback or collaborate.

h1. How to use

Download the jar available in the "Downloads" link above. Then, in the command line, run:

<pre>
java -jar spiral-image-1.0.jar
</pre>

to get more help. For instance, suppose you have a file called "background.jpg" and you want to convert it to 1D. Then you could run:

<pre>
java -jar spiral-image-1.0.jar background.jpg background-1D.jpg
</pre>

This will result in a file called "background-1D.jpg" being created, and this file will be an image with a single line, formed by all the pixels of the original image.

To get the original image back, you need also to say its original size. Suppose it was 1024x768. Then you could run:

<pre>
java -jar spiral-image-1.0.jar background-1D.jpg 1024 768 background-2D.jpg
</pre>

h1. Supported formats

The supported formats depend on your installed Java, but usually include the most common ones: JPG, PNG and BMP.
